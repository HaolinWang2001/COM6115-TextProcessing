# COM6115 TextProcessing
University of Sheffield 2021-22 Autumn COM6115 Text Processing course  
Assignment: Document Retrieval. Completed by Haolin Wang  
`report_acr21hw_HaolinWang.pdf` and `my_retriever.py` are completed for the assignment.  
### Here is my mark and feedback I received on this assignment:  
Total Mark (out of 30): 24  
(The above mark does not include any penalties for late hand-in. Such penalties will be applied at a later stage.) 

**Implementation and Code Style (out of 18):** 14   
**Functionality:**  
All configurations covered. Scores correct for binary and TF term-weighting schemes, but low for TFIDF, suggesting some errors in the implementation.  
**Efficiency:**  
You precompute term IDF values, and doc-vector sizes, during initialisation, which is good re: efficiency.  
**Code Style:**  
Code well-organised and readable, with good variable naming, and a good level of commenting.  

**Report (out of 12):** 10  
**Description of implementation:**  
[Expected only if the implementation is incomplete]  
**Results:**  
A full set of results is presented, including times. Tabulation is helpful to comparison-making. Good use of additional figures to aid exposition.  
**Discussion of results:**  
Good discussion, with sensible observations made about trends in results.
